Palette Dev Engine App Profile services are the set of services that can be put together for App Deployment. 

The basic services available are:

**Container Deployment**: Containers are methods of building, packaging, and deploying an application. A container includes the code, run-time, libraries, and all the dependencies required by a containerized workload. Containers are deployed to their target environment. For steps on how to deploy a container in Palette, refer to Container Deployment.

**Helm**: Palette provides out-of-box Helm registries and allows you to add registries. For more information, visit Palette Helm Registry.

**Manifest**: You can construct App Profile layers using raw manifests to provision Kubernetes resources that are unavailable in Palette or Helm Charts. Pack Manifests provide a pass-through mechanism to orchestrate Kubernetes resources in a cluster. For example, specific integrations may require creation of Secrets or Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs). To achieve this, you can attach a Manifest file to the layer.

**Messaging System Services**: The Messaging System services available for client-server data exchange and monitoring.

**Object Storage Services**: Object storage, also known as object-based storage, is a strategy that manages and manipulates data storage as distinct units, called objects.

**Database Services**: The backend storage services for Palette Dev Engine apps. We support multiple database services.
