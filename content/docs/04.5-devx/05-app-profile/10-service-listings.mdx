Palette Dev Engine App Profile services are the set of services that can be put together for App Deployment. The key services available are:

**Container Deployment**: Containers are methods of building, packaging, and deploying an application. A container includes the code, run-time, libraries, and all the dependencies required by a containerized workload.


**Helm**: Palette leverages Helm registries for out-of-box app deployment.


**Manifest**: You can construct App Profile layers using raw manifests to provision Kubernetes resources that are unavailable in Palette or Helm Charts. 


**Messaging System Services**: The Messaging System services available for client-server data exchange and monitoring.


**Object Storage Services**: Object storage, also known as object-based storage, is a strategy that manages and manipulates data storage as distinct units, called objects.


**Database Services**: The backend storage services for Palette Dev Engine apps. We support multiple database services.
