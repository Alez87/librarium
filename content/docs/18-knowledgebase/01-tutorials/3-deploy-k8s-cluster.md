# Deploy a Kubernetes Cluster with Palette

Palette's purpose is to allow you to creating and managing a Kubernetes host cluster to the public cloud providers with minimal effort. Palette makes possibile for software engineers, application developers, or system administrators that want to deploy a containerized application, to interact with Kubernetes clusters with ease.

The *Cluster Profile* component allows you to customize the cluster infrastructure stack you prefer in a reusable and repetitible way on the main cloud providers.

This tutorial will teach you how to deploy a cluster with Palette . Yu will learn about *Cluster Mode*, *Cluster Profiles*, *Host Cluster* and understand how they enable you to deploy applications to Kubernetes quickly with minimal effort but with high degree of customization.

## UI Workflow

## Prerequisites

To complete this tutorial, you will need the following items.

- A Spectro Cloud account. You can [sign up to Palette](https://console.spectrocloud.com/auth/signup) 
- Basic knowledge about containers.
- Create a Cloud account ([AWS, Azure, GCP ](#providers))
- Basic knowledge of the main public cloud platforms

There are no expenses associated with this tutorial as everything shouldnâ€™t exceed the free tier threshold of the cloud providers.

In case, you want to extend the experiments of this tutorial, exceeding the providers free tier threshold, you can request an authorization to the [Spectro Cloud Free Cloud Credit program](https://docs.spectrocloud.com/getting-started/palette-freemium#requestafreecloudaccount)


## Architecture

In this tutorial the creation of a Kubernetes infrastructure is totally transparent and hidden because Palette manages it completely. In fact, Palette will save you all the effort to create the overall infrastructure, allowing to deploy a production-ready infrastructure with few clicks, and to deploy the application.

This is a semplified architecture overview that shows the infrastructure Palette creates for you into the cloud provider you prefer.

![Infrastructure architecture](deploy-k8s-cluster/architecture_infrastructure.png)

<br />

Palette also makes very easy to deploy an application on Kubernetes because it offer all the support to deploy the application from the yaml templates, with no needs to execute commands towards the cluster.

This is the application architecture you will deploy with this tutorial:

![Application architecture](deploy-k8s-cluster/architecture_application.png)

<br />
<br />


## Deploy the Environment

The following steps will guide you through deploying the cluster infrastructure. You will start with the definition of the cluster profile, then you will create the cluster and launch the provision of the cluster.

From Palette, you will create the cluster and deploy the application. Each cluster will be hosted on a cloud service provider, i.e. AWS, Azure, GCP, and managed through Palette.

<Tabs.TabPane tab="AWS" key="aws">

## Create AWS Account

Go to [AWS home page](https://aws.amazon.com) and follow the [page to create and activate a AWS account](https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/knowledge-center/create-and-activate-aws-account).

When you create an account, we recommend to create another user to execute everyday tasks and give to that user sufficient rights to create the cluster, avoiding to use the root user credentials to perform it.

<br />


## Create Cluster Profile

[Cluster profiles](https://docs.spectrocloud.com/cluster-profiles) are templates that are created with preconfigured core layers (OS, Kubernetes orchestrator, Network, Storage) with the possibility to add several available add-on layers, such as security, monitoring, logging, and so forth. 
Cluster profiles allows to create infrastructural stacks that can be customized in terms of number of layers, type of components, and version and offer a reproducible way to create clusters.

Start by log in to Palette and open the **Profiles** tab on the left panel. 
You can see the list of available default profiles. For now, we create our own profile, so click to **Add Cluster Profile** at the top right side.

Follow the procedure to create a new profile.

In **Basic Information**, insert the name of the profile such as *aws-profile*, a brief  description of the profile, the type as *Full*, and tags as *aws*. You can leave version empty since the version defaults to 1.0.0.

**Cloud Type** allows you to choose the infrastructure provider this profile is associated to. Select *AWS*.

**Profile Layers** is the main configuration steps when you create a profile and you need to specify the packs that compose the profile. There are 4 required infrastructure packs and several optional add-on packs you can choose.
Every pack requires the *Pack Type*, *Registry*, *Pack Name*, *Chart version*, *Manifests* options that compose the *Pack Values* string.

The infrastrucutre packs and their *Pack Values* configuration used in this tutorial are the following:
- **Operating System (OS)** pack type -> *ubuntu-aws LTS__20.4.x*
- **Kubernetes** pack type -> *Kubernetes 1.21.x*
- **Network** pack type -> *cni-calico 3.24.x* (Calico)
- **Storage** pack type -> *csi-aws 1.0.x* (Container Storage Interface - CSI)

We also add, as add-on pack, a reverse proxy to access the web application you are going to deploy later on.
Click on **Add New Pack**, choose **Authentication** as pack type and select the latest version of **Spectro Proxy** pack name with its default manifest.


The **Review** section gives an overview of the cluster profile configuration created.

![aws cluster profile overview page](deploy-k8s-cluster/aws/profile_review.png)

After the creation of a cluster profile, you can update it by adding, removing, or editing layers, in any moment.

<br />


## Create New Cluster

You can open the clusters overview by selecting the **Cluster ** tab on the Palette left panel.

From the clusters page, you can select **Add New Cluster**

![palette clusters overview page](deploy-k8s-cluster/new_cluster.png)

and **Deploy New Cluster** from the pop-up menu.

Choose the cloud provider at your choice, AWS in this case, and **Start AWS Configuration**

This starts the procedure to create configure the cluster on AWS, whose steps are the following.

<br />


### Basic information

In the basic information section, you insert the general information about the cluster, such as the Cluster name, Description, Tags, the Cloud account.

![palette clusters basic information](deploy-k8s-cluster/aws/clusters_basic_info.png)

<br />


### Cluster profile

[Cluster profiles](https://docs.spectrocloud.com/cluster-profiles) are templates that are created with preconfigured core layers (OS, Kubernetes orchestrator, Network, Storage) with the possibility to add several available add-on layers, such as security, monitoring, logging, and so forth. 
Cluster profiles allows to create infrastructural stacks that can be customized in terms of number of layers, type of components, and version and offer a reproducible way to create clusters.

Start by log in to Palette and open the **Profiles** tab on the left panel. 
You can see the list of available default profiles. For now, we create our own profile, so click to **Add Cluster Profile** at the top right side.

Follow the procedure to create a new profile.

In **Basic Information**, insert the name of the profile such as *gcp-profile*, a brief  description of the profile, the type as *Full*, and tags as *gcp". You can leave version empty since the version defaults to 1.0.0.

**Cloud Type** allows you to choose the infrastructure provider this profile is associated to. Select *Google Cloud*.

**Profile Layers** is the main configuration steps when you create a profile and you need to specify the packs that compose the profile. There are 4 required infrastructure packs and several optional add-on packs you can choose.
Every pack requires the *Pack Type*, *Registry*, *Pack Name*, *Chart version*, *Manifests* options that compose the *Pack Values* string.

The infrastrucutre packs and their *Pack Values* configuration used in this tutorial are the following:
- **Operating System (OS)** pack type -> *ubuntu-gcp LTS__20.4.x*
- **Kubernetes** pack type -> *Kubernetes 1.21.x*
- **Network** pack type -> *cni-calico 3.24.x* (Calico)
- **Storage** pack type -> *csi-gcp 1.0.x* (Google Compute Engine persistent disk Container Storage Interface - GCE CSI)

We also add, as add-on pack, a reverse proxy to access the web application you are going to deploy later on.
Click on **Add New Pack**, choose **Authentication** as pack type and select the latest version of **Spectro Proxy** pack name with its default manifest.


The **Review** section gives an overview of the cluster profile configuration created.

![aws cluster profile overview page](deploy-k8s-cluster/gcp/profile_review.png)

After the creation of a cluster profile, you can update it by adding, removing, or editing layers, in any moment.

<br />


### Parameters

The parameters section resumes the list of infrastructure layers and the list of add-on components.

![palette clusters basic information](deploy-k8s-cluster/aws/clusters_parameters.png)

For each component, there is a manifest with the deploy configurations.

The default manifest is already suitable for production environment since it already includes a working configuration and the most of the hardening standards recommended for production environments.
Despite that, you can edit the default manifest, customizing the deploy configuration.

<br />


### Cluster config

The cluster config section allows to select the Region where to deploy among the ones provided by the cloud providers and the SSH Key Pair to use.

![palette clusters basic information](deploy-k8s-cluster/aws/clusters_cluster_config.png)

Create an SSH key pair from the AWS dashboard.
Open the [Amazon EC2 console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2) and, in the navigation panel, under Network & Security, choose Key Pairs.
Choose Create key pair and enter the information required to create the key pair:  a descriptive name for the key, the type of key pair, and the private key file format. Then, select to Create a key pair.

![aws key pair creation](deploy-k8s-cluster/aws/key_pair_create.png)

<br />


### Nodes config

The node config section allows to configure the type of nodes you will use as master and worker nodes in the Kubernetes configuration.

You can find the list and the explaination of all the paramerters in [Node Pool page](https://docs.spectrocloud.com/clusters/cluster-management/node-pool).

Among the multiple configuration you can set, be sure to consider:
- *Number of nodes in the pool* to set the right amount of nodes that compose the pool of either the master or worker nodes. For the tutorial we set 1 for the master pool and 2 for the worker pool
- *Allow worker capability* to allow the master node also to accept workloads. This option is particularly useful in case you select *spot instance* as worker nodes in order to guarantee a minimum number of available nodes on the cluster. For the tutorial we check it.
- *Instance Type* to select the amount of resources each node must have. Each instance type shows the amount of vCPU, RAM and the hourly cost of the instance.
- *Availability zones* to use within the Region seleted in the *Cluster config* section.
- *Instance Option* to choose between [on-demand instance](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ec2-on-demand-instances.html) and [spot instance](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/spot/) as worder nodes. 
  - (in case of spot instance) *Maximum spot bid price* to set the bid price threshold to get instances. For this tutorial, you can select spot instance to minimize cost but make sure you check the *Allow worker capability* flag.

![palette clusters basic information](deploy-k8s-cluster/aws/clusters_nodes_config.png)

<br />


### Settings

In the Settings section you can select advanced configurations about the management of the instances, such as when to patch the OS, enable security scans, manage backups, add role-based access control (RBAC), enable virtual clusters.

For the purpose of this tutorial, you can use the default settings configuration.

<br />


### Review

The review section resumes the cluster configuration as you have configured it in the previous steps.

##  Terraform

Palette supports the open-source Infrastructure as Code (IaC) software tool, [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/), to provide consistent CLI workflow support to multiple cloud services.

The [Spectro Cloud Terraform](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/spectrocloud/spectrocloud/latest/docs) provider enables you to create and manage Palette resources in a codified manner by leveraging Infrastructure as Code (IaC). There are many reasons why you would want to utilize IaC. A few reasons worth highlighting are: the ability to automate infrastructure, improve collaboration related to infrastructure changes, self-document infrastructure through codification, and track all infrastructure in a single source of truth. 

If you need to become more familiar with Terraform, check out the [Why Terraform](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/intro) explanation from HashiCorp. 


## Prerequisites

To complete this tutorial, you will need the following items.

- A Spectro Cloud account
- Basic knowledge about containers.
- Terraform v1.3.6 or greater
- Git v2.30.0 or greater 
- A Spectro Cloud API key. To learn how to create an API key

There are no expenses associated with this tutorial as everything falls under the Palette Free Tier.

## Deploy The Application

The following steps will guide you through deploying the application on the cluster. You will start with the modification of the cluster profile with the addition of the manifest, then the configuration of the manifest, and the deploy of the application.
The deploy of the application can be done when you create the cluster or, like in this tutorial, after the creation of the cluster.

<br />

### Add The Manifest

Return to the *Profiles* tabs on the left panel and open the profile related to the cluster deployed.

Select *Add Manifest* at the top of the page and insert the data:
- *layer name*: name of the pack to add to the profile stack
- *Manifests*: add your manifest by giving it a name and click on the blue tick to confirm it.

![manifest](deploy-k8s-cluster/manifest.png)

<br />


### Customise The Manifest

From the *editor* icon next to the manifest you can switch between the text editor and the overview of the profile stack.

Click on the manifest to prompt a text file on the right side. Here you add the code to deploy the application.
The manifest example code to deploy the *hello-universe* application is the following.

<br />

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: hello-universe-service
spec:
  type: LoadBalancer
  ports:
  - protocol: TCP
    port: 8080
    targetPort: 8080
  selector:
    app: hello-universe
---
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: hello-universe-deployment
spec:
  replicas: 2
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: hello-universe
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: hello-universe
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: hello-universe
        image: ghcr.io/spectrocloud/hello-universe:1.0.9
        imagePullPolicy: IfNotPresent
        ports:
        - containerPort: 8080
```

In this code example, we deploy the [*hello-universe*](https://github.com/spectrocloud/hello-universe) demo application.

We set 2 replicas to simulate a minimal distributed environment with a redountant web application deployed on Kubernetes. In front of them, we add a load balancer service to route requests across all replica containers as best practice to maximize the workload and to expose a single access point to the web application.

For more information about the service LoadBalancer component you can refer to the [Kuberntes official documentation](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/service/#loadbalancer).

<br />

### Deploy

Select the **Clusters** page from the left panel and click on the cluster to open the details page.

![Cluster details with available updates](deploy-k8s-cluster/deploy_app/updates_available.png)

<br />

On the top right corner you'll see a green button **Updates Available** that shows you have updates to deploy on the cluster.
Click on it to see the modification of the current profile with the last deployed and revise the application configurations.

![Available updates details](deploy-k8s-cluster/deploy_app/updates_available_details.png)

Click on **Confirm updates** to finalize the modification of the profile and apply the configuration of the application on the cluster.

<br />


## Validation

Click on **Workloads** on the top of the page:

![Workloads](deploy-k8s-cluster/workloads.png)

This tab opens an overview of the Kubernetes components. From there you can check if the application components have been created successfully:
- select the **Namespace** tab and check for a namespace called *cluster-xxxxxx*
- select the **Deployment** tab and check for the *hello-universe-deployment* deployment
- select the **Pods** tab and check for two pods with name *hello-universe-xxxxxx*

Next to the pods name check the pods *ready* information

Access the application: click on Service button ...

## Next Steps

In this tutorial, you learned about Paletteâ€™s Dev Engine and App Mode. You deployed two virtual clusters, each containing a different architecture and configuration of the Hello Universe application. Paletteâ€™s Dev Engine enables developers to quickly deploy applications into a Kubernetes environment without requiring Kubernetes knowledge. In a matter of minutes, you deployed a new Kubernetes cluster and all its applications without having to write Kubernetes configuration files.
