# Creating your first Cluster Profile

After logging in, select the `Cluster Profiles` option from the left pane. This is the place where the user accesses the cluster profiles available.

P.S.: There __can__ be profiles that you see even though you have logged in for the first time. This is a part of the [User Management](link) and is explained in detail in that section.

Click on the `Add Cluster Profile` button. This opens up the profile creation page where the name of the profile and an (optional) short description can be added. The profiles created can be assigned with tags, if needed, to help in faster identification.

Choose your cloud service provider and proceed with the configuration. Note that the configuration options change depending on the choice of the service provider. Check the [Examples (AWS, VMWare, Azure)](link)" for detailed configuration steps for various cloud service providers.

Once the configuration is done, you can review the configuration before saving it. If some changes are in order, clicking the texts (`Basic Information`, `Cloud Type` or `Profile Layers`) will open the corresponding screens.

You can click the `API` button to get the POST API URL for creating clusters as per the cluster profile that you created.

When everything is set, the `Finish` button on the top right corner will confirm the creation of the new cluster profile.
