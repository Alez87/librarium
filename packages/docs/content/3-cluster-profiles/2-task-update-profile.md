# Updating a Cluster Profile

Follow the steps in the [Create Profile](link) section to create a cluster profile. Once created, a cluster profile can be accessed from the `Cluster Profiles` section on the left pane. Click on an existing cluster profile to view further information about it. This opens a page containing the following tabs: `Basic Information` and `Layers & Parameters`.

The `Basic Information` tab shows the name, description (if any) and tags (if any) as well as the profile creation's timestamp. The basic information of the profile can be edited using the `Edit Info` button or deleted using the `Delete` button.

Note: Deleting the profile is *_not_* possible until there are active clusters deployed using these cluster profiles.

Clicking the `Layers & Parameters` button opens up the configuration tab. Additional layers can be added using the `New Layer` tab on the top right corner. Existing layers can be changed by clicking on either the layer icons on the stack or by clicking on the corresponding buttons on the right.
