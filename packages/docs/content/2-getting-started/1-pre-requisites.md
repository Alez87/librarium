# For AWS

1. You will need to have key pairs created locally like [here.](https://www.ssh.com/ssh/keygen/#creating-an-ssh-key-pair-for-user-authentication) Please ensure that both the key files (*.pub and *.pem) are located and stored in an accessible folder.
    P.S.: If you see a *.pub but no *.pem, rename the file to add the .pem extension.

2. An active AWS cloud account with the key pairs created by [importing your keys.](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ec2-key-pairs.html#how-to-generate-your-own-key-and-import-it-to-aws)
